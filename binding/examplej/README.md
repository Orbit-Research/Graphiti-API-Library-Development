Place any .java files into this folder and run the runJava.ps1 command and the .java files will be compiled and run with the library.

Make sure to do: "import binding.jgraphiti.Graphiti;" in any .java file(s) that use the graphiti library

The java library depends on files:
- hidapi_winapi.h
- hidapi.h
- hidapi.dll
- libGraphiti.dll
- libGraphiti.dll.a
- libGraphitiJNI.dll
- libGraphitiJNI.dll.a
- All Graphiti .class files
- Header files of the cpp library (To the best of my knowledge)
